Description:

Parameter 4 of constructor in com.appsdeveloperblog.photoapp.api.users.service.UsersServiceImpl required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- feignLoggerLevel: defined by method 'feignLoggerLevel' in com.appsdeveloperblog.photoapp.api.users.PhotoAppApiUsersApplication
	- feignDefaultLoggerLevel: defined by method 'feignDefaultLoggerLevel' in com.appsdeveloperblog.photoapp.api.users.PhotoAppApiUsersApplication


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed
